# Find an address instructions
First hasty draft... 
The address finder results are based on 3 JSON data files in the Data folder in this folder. 
* The original data is in an Excel CSV file that is also duplicated online at: 
* There are 3 tabs in the file, one for each JSON data file. 
* To update the data anytime, make your edits to the Excel file (or into the Google doc)  then paste the data into this site: 
  * https://csvjson.com/csv2json
  * then paste that new JSON into the datafiles 
  * which file to paste into depends on what you changed - if you changed only the address file, just paste that one
  * if you added a new treatment, and applied that treatment to a form in the form file, and added a new address to the address file, then do all three
