# cra-contactus
## Contact optimization project with CRA

A collaboration between TBS Digital Transformation Office and Employment and Social Development Canada

__Outcome we are working towards: Fewer people call/mail, and those that do, get the right number/address__

This repo holds a prototype of a new task-based design for Contact the Canada Revenue Agency to improve citizen success. The targets for this project are to improve user success by at least 20 percentage points at finding the telephone numbers and the right addresses. 

A baseline round of task-scenario testing on the live version of Canada.ca in January 2019 produced a task performance measurement for each of the scenarios. The behaviour of the small-business owners in the study also highlighted critical usability problems.  Working together as a collaborative team across the departments, we will design and implement solutions in these prototype pages. A second round of validation testing with a different set of Canadian participants was conducted in late March. Participants in that study used this prototype rather than the live site, to test that the success rates are improved. Since then, some fine tuning and building out of the pages has been done and the tested version has been archived.
